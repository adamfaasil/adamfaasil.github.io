    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
        As a new 20 year old developer, I am embarking on an exciting journey in the world of technology. <br>With a
        burgeoning passion for coding and a thirst for knowledge, I am eagerly <br> learning the ropes of software
        development. My enthusiasm and curiosity drive me to <br> explore various programming languages, frameworks, and
        tools, as I seek to expand my <br> skillset and tackle increasingly complex challenges. My adaptability and
        resilience shine <br> through as I overcome obstacles, and my determination to grow is a testament <br> to my
        potential. My fresh perspective and creative thinking bring a unique and valuable perspective <br> to any
        development team. With a commitment to continuous learning and a drive to make a meaningful <br> contribution to
        the ever-evolving tech landscape, My potential as a new developer is boundless, <br> and my future in this field
        is filled with promises and opportunity.
